            <h2>Identity and Belonging</h2>
            <p>Noah is a biracial kid and his background makes him<br>
               feel like an outsider in the society didvided rigidly<br>
               by race.However, he navigates these divisions and finds<br>
               his own sense of belonging.<br>
               Apartheid's rules on jobs and homes make things tougher,<br>
                keeping black families trapped with little money. Trevor's<br>
                 shoplifting group becomes his community, welcoming him <br>
                 despite his “crime” of being mixed.

            <h2>Humor As Armor</h2>
            <p>Trevor Noah can be seen using humor in his book ”Born<br>
                A Crime” to deal with traumatic events, hence engaging<br>
                the reader. For example, in chapter one called “Run”, <br>
                Trevor begins his story with being thrown out of the <br>
                vehicle at the age of nine. This occurrence was very <br>
                frightening and serious, but with the lighthearted tone, <br>
                a reader cannot help but laugh.<br>
                He also used humor to navigate the oppressive system, <br>
                which happened to lessen the heaviness of the content. <br>
                This manner of approach enabled him to address serious <br>
                issues in a manner that was fit for his audience. 
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue3">
            <h2>Poverty and Inequality</h2>
            <p>Noah's upbringing in marginalized communities reveals<br>
               the cyclical nature of poverty and its impact on <br>
               individuals and communities . System oppression can <br>
               lead to limited opportunities and perpetuation of poverty,<br>
               echoing ongoing struggles faced by vulnerable populations<br>
               in various parts of the world.

        <div class="issue4">
            <h2>Apartheid's Lasting Barriers</h2>
            <p>Old-school expectations made things tougher-women <br>
                like Patricia were supposed to focus on family, often<br>
                 helping men like Abel, whose garage didn't work out.<br>
                  Apartheid's separation split communities, leaving <br>
                  them clueless about each other's lives. Still,Trevor's <br>
                  hard work builds a group with other drivers, sharing ways<br>
                   to avoid cops, a bit like the “Black tax,” where those doing <br>
                   well help those who aren't. In my town, schools in minority<br>
                    areas get less money, showing this gap, and in the U.S., <br>
                    housing differences are similar. Trevor's story proves that<br>
                     communities give a sense of belonging despite systems that<br>
                      push people out.
