                <P>


                    The Handmaid's Tale is one of Margaret Atwood’s most famous works. (Largely due to the TV series
                    that gained so many audiences).
                    The book is a seminal work of dystopian fiction that explores different themes of gender oppression
                    (particularly female), power,
                    control, and the resilience of the human spirit. The book is set in a plausible future, and it
                    remains interestingly relevant .
                    The author has presented the book as a forecast of what may happen shortly, where governments will
                    have been taken over and ruled
                    by right-wingers and religious fundamentalists. Males will be restored to their traditional role of
                    warrior, and the women to
                    “their roles”.The women will have been divided into wives, breeders, servants, and many more.

                    I believe the book is aimed at readers of all audiences as it sets a pace for patriarchal criticisms
                    and theoretical rules which
                    is happening even in the world today. Atwood's art of bringing out the best narrative by the persona
                    has made the book set cement
                    in as one of the good feminist literature.</P>
                <P>In the book, much of America is overthrown, and it is set in the Republic of Gilead, a theocratic
                    society. Due to widespread

                    infertility caused by environmental degradation and sexually transmitted diseases, fertile women
                    referred to as Handmaids are
                    forced into reproductive schemes. The story is narrated by the character Offred, and the readers
                    depict the story from the persona’s
                    point of view . She explains how her life and other handmaids are under surveillance and control,
                    and her identity and name are now
                    unrecognizable and reduced to her biological function. In the house, there are different roles, each
                    with a hierarchy of its own.
                    The narrator, OffRed, lives in the Commander’s house, where her main role is to breed, and the
                    children she bears will automatically
                    belong to the wife (Serena Joy) and the Commander. She goes on and states that after a successful
                    breeding, the handmaids are then
                    transferred to the next commander to perform the same duties.</P>
                <!-- <div class="book-image">

</div> -->
                <p>The story follows Offred’s journey from the years before the rise of Gilead to how she was forced to
                    train under very cruel aunts,
                    such as Aunt Lydia, who believed in this way of life and used religion to justify the oppression.
                    They would quote bible verses such
                    as “blessed be the fruit of your womb” to implant in the handmaid’s mind that their main role on
                    earth is to sire children. Instead
                    of focusing on specific events, the novel would switch from flashbacks and present scenes, just like
                    the human mind which gets
                    distracted from thought to thought. I feel the author allowed the users to experience the real human
                    emotions and thoughts together
                    with the persona as they read through the book. However, this would sometimes cause me confusion as
                    unexpected time shifts would
                    happen, and it was hard to comprehend where the scene was set.

                    Artwood presents a stark vision of a society where women are stratified and controlled based on
                    their fertility and their roles as Wives,
                    Marthas, and handmaids, showing how Gilead institutionalizes sexism and uses religious doctrines to
                    justify oppression. In the story,
                    Ofred remembers her previous life with Luke and her daughter, and how she used to have a job, but it
                    was all stripped off. She yearns
                    for the freedom she had before over her own body and her environment.</p>
                <p>Despite all these oppressive actions, the human spirit persists, and it is seen by how Offred had
                    quiet acts of rebellion through her
                    affair with Nick and the Commander. She also narrates how her friend Moira was resistant and her
                    endless attempts at escape. Moira’s

                    first escape attempt was met by a cruel punishment of breaking her legs, but she later succeeded,
                    and I feel this was an encouragement
                    to Offred to explore the possibility of freedom in her own mind.

                    The commander, too, had all the power and status in Gilead state, yet he still felt compelled to
                    break the rules by having unauthorized
                    interaction with Fred. I also note that despite the rules, Serena Joy was helping institute, she
                    helped Ofred have an affair with Nick

                    to sire a child for the commander. Serena Joy is also trapped in the same rules, where she's not
                    allowed to read and write. This depicts

                    how, even in today’s society, the creators of the rules are usually among the breakers of the rules.
                </p>
                <p>The aunts, on the other hand, are depicted as the true believers of the Gilead philosophy, and I feel
                    this is due to the position of power

                    that they hold in the society. On the other hand, Ofred’s shopping power is depicted as more
                    proactive and rebellious, while Ofwarren is seen
                    as someone who has already found joy in her reality, and this makes her unpopular among the
                    handmaids. This depiction of characters made it
                    more believable and relatable.</p><br>

                <p>I particularly loved Atwood’s writing style, given that it is the first book of hers that I have
                    read. She was lyrical and restrained, often
                    infused with poetic introspection. I loved how the narrative alternates from present-day Gilead and
                    Offred’s memories, creating an emotional
                    resonance of loss and endurance. Her use of internal monologue of Offred allowed me to relate and
                    feel her psyche, fear, hope, and occasional
                    dark humor.
                    I also love how the book has raised debates on women’s rights and reproductive rights in society. I
                    believe the book will be timeless and will
                    be relatable across every time frame. I believe the novel opens every reader's eyes to discussions
                    on bodily autonomy, religious fundamentalism,
                    and authoritarianism. The complete reimagining of society as shown in the novel allows us as readers
                    to ask ourselves: What if? If the deliberately
                    extreme society of Gilead existed, what would it look like, and how would people react within it?
                </p><br>


                <p>As much as I enjoyed the book, I feel that the constant shift in scenes from backflash to present
                    scenes was a bit more confusing to me .
                    The extreme description of the setting also created a sense of agency to get to the end of the
                    scene.Overall, the book is a cautionary tale,
                    and I did enjoy reading it. It is a must-read for anyone who loves thought-provoking literature. I’d
                    recommend the book, and I look forward
                    to reading more of Artwood's Literature works.</p>
