                <p id="atwood">
                    The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is a story about a woman named Offred in
                    a scary future where a strict religious group called Gilead rules America. Women have no freedom,
                    and Offred is a Handmaid, forced to have babies for a powerful man, the Commander, and his wife,
                    Serena Joy. She lives under tight control, always watched, and remembers her old life with her
                    husband and daughter, who were taken away.

                <p id="partriparagraph">
                    Patriarchy is a social system built upon unequal power relations that men maintain over
                    women.<br> In “The Handmaid’s Tale”, patriarchy is a theme that illustrates Gilead’s social
                    structure,
                    the <br>oppressive control men exert over women, and how it devalues women of their reproductive
                    roles,<br> individuality, and basic rights. Men held all political, social, and economic power,
                    while
                    women were<br> categorized by their roles, eg, wives, marthas, and handmaids, each with a specific
                    role.
                    The handmaids,<br> for instance, were reduced to their ability to bear children and were seen as
                    instruments of procreation,<br> while the wives were valued for their obedience to their husbands
                    and the ability to run their households.<br> The novel also highlights religious patriarchy in the
                    sense that roles for men and women were shaped <br>around biblical ideas of gender. For instance, in
                    the bible where a slave or servant would perform the role<br> of a concubine, with the resulting
                    children being considered as part of another woman. In Gilead, women <br>are stripped of their
                    economic, political, and reproductive rights which aligns to the situations in our society<br>
                    where women face discrimination in employment, limited access to education and restrictions in
                    their bodily<br> rights for example, child marriages, forced marriages and lack of access to
                    abortion
                    services are real life<br> manifestations of control over women’s lives.

                    In the Handmaid's Tale, power is the main issue. Gilead’s leaders control everyone,<br>
                    especially women. The government, run mostly by men, takes away people's freedom<br> to keep
                    itself in charge. Women like Offred, a Handmaid, are treated like objects, given<br> names like
                    “Of Fred” to show they belong to their commanders. They can’t make their <br>own choices, and
                    harsh punishments, like public hangings, scare them into obeying. <br>Gilead also uses spies,
                    called the Eyes, who watch everyone’s every move, making<br> people afraid to speak out or act
                    against the rules. But not everyone gives in. Off

            <div>
                <p id="fearparagraph">
                    In the book ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’, the concept of fear is exposed in many occasions amongst
                    the young<br> women, who were only for the role of surrogacy, within the oppressive society of
                    Gilead. Today, even in the<br> contrast of societal settings between Gilead and current society, the
                    concept of fear is still portrayed in many<br> aspects. The Gilead setting was that, in any case of
                    deviation from expected moral conduct, such as trying to<br> escape from designated bounds and
                    committing adultery, heavy punishments, which are: breaking of legs and<br> being hung publicly
                    respectively for the above cases, were executed on the victims, not only to stop them from<br>
                    messing up again but also to send out a warning to the rest, who seemed to be lucky not to be
                    in that situation<br> for the moment. Current society reveals fear in almost similar circumstances
                    of unfair treatment yet choosing <br>to move on in silence. For example the fear to lose one’s job
                    because of complaints to unfair work conditions,<br> the fear of imprisonment because of criticism
                    to prevailing authorities and this can even include death cases <br>and cases of abduction, fear of
                    religious leaders who tend to threaten their audiences with disastrous <br>experiences for violation
                    of any instructions, among other fears.

                <p id="religionparagraph">
                    In “The Handmaid's Tale”, religion is one of the main means of control used by
                    Gilead.<br> Where the society was heavily influenced by interpretation of the bible.
                    Gilead claims<br> to promote christianity values such as charity and forgiveness,
                    while in reality these<br> values are distorted and used as a way to
                    promote the oppression of women. In the<br> book, people in power use certain
                    passages from the bible like the phrase “Blessed<br> be the fruit” which is used as a
                    greeting among handmaids, underscores their sole<br> purpose of
                    reproduction, reducing their identity to their biological function. This is also <br>still
                    a big issue in today’s society, where because of religion women are
                    manipulated<br> to believe they are only meant for some things not the other,
                    mainly in African societies<br> like Rwanda specifically where some churches
                    prohibit women from doing certain roles,<br> or having certain rights like how
                    the bible says women should be submissive. This is<br> used in today’s world
                    to manipulate women into believing they are meant to be just house<br> wives
                    who respect and do whatever men say in the form of being respectful to men
                    no <br>matter how badly they are treated.

                <p id="agencyparagraph">
                    In The Handmaid’s Tale the concept of loss of agency refers to
                    the systematic stripping away of individual<br> autonomy and
                    freedom, particularly women within the oppressive society of
                    Gilead. Gilead’s regime controls<br> women’s bodies, identities,
                    and decision-making ability by reducing them to vessels for
                    procreation and <br> instruments of state control. Women are
                    categorized as the handmaids (Tasked with reproduction
                    only), the <br> Marthas (tasked with doing the house chores), and
                    the Elites (wives to the commanders). The handmaids are<br> 
                    assigned to reproduce for the Elites, stripped of their personal
                    freedom and forced to engage in sexual acts for<br>  procreation.
                    The Marthas, Aunts, and Wives are subjected to varying
                    degrees of control and restriction, lacking<br>  autonomy in their
                    lives. This shows the complete absence of reproductive rights
                    for women in Gilead, who are not<br>  allowed to make decisions
                    about their own bodies or future pregnancies. Gilead
                    systematically eliminates individual<br>  names and identities,
                    replacing them with assigned roles that reinforce the societal
                    hierarchy. Women are denied <br> access to education,
                    employment, and personal property, further limiting their
                    capacity for independent thought and<br>  action. Gilead’s color
                    coded attire and strict rules regarding  appearance furthercoded attire and strict rules
                    regarding<br>  appearance further emphasize the suppression of individual expression and
                    identity. The women are novice in political<br>  decisions or the
                    legal system. Even seemingly mundane aspects of daily life,
                    like shopping or travel, are controlled by <br> others. The threat of
                    severe punishment for any deviation from the prescribed rules
                    reinforces the lack of agency and<br>  fosters a climate of fear and
                    compliance. While women in Gilead are largely powerless, the
                    novel also explores subtle <br> forms of resistance such as
                    maintaining personal memories, relationships, or acts of
                    defiance. The novel’s narration by<br>  Offred highlights the
                    importance of language as a means of resistance and
                    maintaining a sense of self. Even in the face<br>  of immense
                    oppression, the characters hold on to a glimmer of hope for
                    escape and a future where they can exercise <br> their agency.
